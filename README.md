# Xlab

This repository follows a level-based difficulty structure. For example:

- 1001: Beginner level, first file
- 1002: Beginner level, second file
- 2001: Intermediate level, first file
- 3001: Advanced level, first file

Currently, we do not include C or C++ files in order to focus on more human-readable examples for practical scenarios. After completing part of the roadmap, we plan to provide guides and examples in C and C++ for real-world optimized scenarios.

# Code of Conduct

We are currently establishing guidelines to ensure that readers can review materials smoothly and that contributors can collaborate effectively.

Our goal is to create an environment where all practitioners can contribute in their own way. We do not intend to enforce overly strict rules; however, some guidelines are necessary to maintain consistency and quality across the repository.
